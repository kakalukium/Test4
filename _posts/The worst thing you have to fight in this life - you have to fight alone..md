The worst thing you have to fight in this life - you have to fight alone.

Be it betrayal, temptation, grief, or a secret emptiness in your heart.

In your most difficult task - no soul is able to help you.

 If more humans understood this, we would be far kinder to one another.

Personally, cleanliness and hygiene is my primary metric.

When it comes to dealing with people and forming opinions on them.

A truly spiritual person would never be dirty and filthy if they have the means to be presentable and clean. Their language wouldn't be filthy either.

Some people are intuitive, others are connected.

Intuition is emerging, connection is constant.

These are two different things.

A part of growing spiritually is differentiating spiritual phenomena so that you can assign correct terms to correct physiognomies.

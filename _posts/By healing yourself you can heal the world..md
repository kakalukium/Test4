**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2025-08-14](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1955907960380490235/history)

By healing yourself you can heal the world.

You might think I'm not right in the head for saying this, but I know science will prove it eventually - that all humans are connected by something very physical and real - something electromagnetic that can span incredible distances.

If you focus hard enough, and if you are naturally a strong receiver, you can sense how other humans are emitting this energy at all times - even while they sleep, to a lesser extent.

Whole cloud formations and even weather is formed and affected by these wavelengths, and weather manipulation also forms and changes collective thought patterns if you invert this effect.

I've always known this because I've always felt it.

When you are a high-consciousness receiver, you not only receive these readings but can also throw them back into the etheric field - and these things are whole cities wide.

Just being in the presence of heightened consciousness literally reframes your surroundings and quantum disposition of reality itself. Distance matters in this very profound way.

Distance from and distance to.

There's a higher intuition and a lesser intuition - and lesser intuition lends itself to you through this collective mechanism. You know things about other things because other people are delivering this knowledge to you through subtle means.

A collective dialled-in knowing is what I refer to as the lesser intuition and a personal, divine knowing is what I refer to as higher intuition.

The stronger and more intense the emotional charge, the stronger this thing reverberates in the field - and I would bet that there is existing technology that can map these emotional and psychic "bursts" in real time with ease.

When you move around, you impress your consciousness unto the world - and the stronger your impression, the higher volume your consciousness holds - the stronger the quantum disposition is.

Others experience objective and the collective-consensus reality through the lens of the most powerful receiver/transceiver.

Once a critical point is reached, quantum portals become available - and reality becomes malleable to change and de-solidifies, it becomes suggestive - events, occurrences, intuitive insights, et cetera.

This is why my ultimate goal and vision for the world has been to plant seeds of harmony, peace and beauty - in absolute quietude, so that there are no disruptive elements that might cause dissonance to the work.

But mine is not a utopian peace, but an inner and pragmatic one that can be first maintained in places of divinity and then spread out throughout these vast distances and subtly planted within the collective psyche - the ethero-spiritual network.

![The image depicts a robed, hooded figure with a mask-like face, sitting cross-legged in a field of colorful flowers under a starry night sky with wavy, ethereal lines above. A glowing heart radiates from the figure\'s chest, and one hand forms a meditative gesture while the other rests on their lap, suggesting spiritual or psychic energy. The post text by JACK OF FACES (@JackOfFaces) describes a belief in human interconnectedness through electromagnetic energy, healing, and collective consciousness, implying the figure represents a high-consciousness receiver influencing reality.

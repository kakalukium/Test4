**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2025-09-14](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1967049001942777961)

What's fascinating is that the problems of the world can all be boiled down to one's inability to cope with their current reality.

And all problems of this world, in truth, are humanitarian crises. They're very human issues at heart, hidden behind clever bureaucracy, semantics and demagoguery of all kinds.

The conflict, as it has always been, lies at the heart of each and every human being. In truth, my belief is that this is the only thing that can be truly transmuted, and the world transmuted only through the magical effect of the "sudden change of heart".

When life becomes stale and hostile, we react for survival.

When I was younger, a large proponent of my life went by rather unlived. I existed to endure, and I endured to dare to hope that, one day, I would not have to endure any longer.

But when you've survived for so long, reacting to what feels like an endless barrage of life's torments and tribulations - when the time comes to unwind and unfold - you fail to act.

Not because you have no desire, but because you've genuinely become too accustomed to your environment dictating what you should be doing.

You are married to the struggle, so to speak.

Like coming out of an extended prison sentence, the wild and wide yonder of the modern pseudo-world at your feet - it can feel more than just intimidating.

When we freeze up and live a reactionary life, all that's really left is to wait for someone or something that victimizes us, so that we can be sprung back into action.

Problem is, if all you're doing is reacting - are you really living at all?

Many minds today are in an endless battle with the external, and in an endless battle with themselves. They need to antagonise something, or someone - because it is their only source of agency and power, their only means to incite action.

Otherwise, they cannot move. On their own, they're unable to initiate life.

And does life need initiating? Of course, it does.

When you walk into a room, where every unspoken desire, secret longing, buried emotions hang in the heavy air - you are given the opportunity to not only initiate these events and jumpstart them into unfolding, but to alter and even help transmute these discomforts.

But I've found that one is only able to achieve this effect when they don't project their own insecurities and hostilities onto situations.

It blinds them to what truly needs addressing. If all you do is wait for the "thing" to happen, it will never really come.

But it will always feel like it's coming, leaving you in a state of perpetual readiness (and exhaustion), like nocking an arrow on a bow and only firing once you can't hold on any longer.

This is how the energy of most humans feel nowadays - an incredible tension and pressure that is never truly expressed, until it can no longer be contained.

Meaningful action is the equivalent of aiming the arrow, and initiating the situations that will grant you, and others, positive outcomes. What guides the shot is not calculative measures but the force of intuition.

Remember, you are here, in this strange and infinite world, on a rather finite and fleeting deadline. And you are here to arrive to a very specific place, in a specific time, for a very specific purpose.

And you cannot get there by stumbling into every tree you run into.

Sometimes, in order to wake yourself up from the disillusionment of victimhood and passivity - you need to take the shot.

Compared to a thousand shots in the dark, the usefulness of a single arrow is quantified by the will, intent and accuracy of the shooter. Be the hand that casts the moment, take the shot and try to live with intention.

Every great result is the result of a choice once cast with determination and surety.

Your mind opens portals.

Your spirit maintains them.

This war has no other battlefield than the collective heart of humanity.

Death is not in the chanting of witches,

Nor is it a curse that appeases the night.

Death is no devil singing in hiding,

Death is the wings of a blackbird in flight.

Whatever drives you might drive someone else insane.

Especially if what drives you is God.

It's not your job to explain the path to others.

Just that you walk it well.

Your example is the strongest proof

There are four divine directors given to you in this life that help you align with your purpose.

Conscience - when you are overstepping.

Intuition - when you lack understanding.

Ambition - when you are called to act.

Desire - when you are called to create.

Study religiously.

We all serve some sort of archetypal fundament of creation - that's how elemental forces work.

If you appease the forces of conquest, for example, you will be rewarded better fortune in competitions and win unfairly, or through sheer luck.

Great for your ego but trash for soul.

People who unconsciously serve the forces of dominance and tyrant entities tend to win often, mostly in meaningless things like a friendly match of poker or street basketball.

But never win in anything substantial, that's the payoff.

They tend to revel in the victories as well.

What is it called when you do not value anything that's not substantial and easily accept small defeats consistently without hindrance on your psychological state? What are the results and tradeoffs of such actions?


How does one appease these forces?

Simple - pick a domain and further its cause.

For example, I use my energy to enforce the popularization of this or that sport, or competition, or tournament - I get that energy back in the form of favours.

But the favours are NEVER worth it.

**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2025-08-28](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1961038586234404950/history)

We are in this dirty, polluted, corrupted paradise.

The brightest among us long for a past that never was.

They live and die doing so, yearning for a life that never came to be.

The promise of that better world - one that I know exists, even now, and has existed in your past mind - it never became realised. Deep down, you felt betrayed by the world - yet you could not quite place why. This is the underlying, secret suffering of all of our species as of today.

Everything else, all the trauma, disappointment, anger, hatred that is consuming this plane with endless wars, violence and degradation - stems from this singular, unexplained sense of confusion that has gripped a world awakened by its own darkness, and the sudden realization of its spiritual emptiness having set in such profound, raw brutality.

We, humanity, are lost. We cannot reclaim our past innocence, no matter how hard we try. In fact, we have, collectively, given up on trying.

This current world, this timeline, is the direct result of that. We don't know how truly broken we are and are yet to realise that some things are beyond repair - especially our collective memory.

When the timelines split, most people forgot about the previous world, the previous timeline. They have no recollection of it whatsoever. This has happened many times in the span of humanity's interdimensional and historical chronology.

Yet how can a people of science study phenomena they do not even remember occurring? We are an amnesiac species, all of us - but we were not always.

There are some, kindred souls to mine, who share that faint recollection of the true magic of this Earthly domain. Who see and hear visions of what could have been - and what might still come to be.

Yet there is also a profound sadness and a growing hopelessness that comes with the grief of that knowing, seeing just how far we have departed from living in that beautiful, grandiose place. Not some heavenly realm that exists among the clouds, or a place of respite from a children's tale, but a place as real as this one - a thing that can be touched, felt, and lived.

The remembrance, the vestige of this world will sometimes sour into a curse. It will break a man down and force him into escapism in the beauty of art, dance and song. But the task at hand, with its utmost importance - is one that demands of those who carry the remnants of these memories to reignite that same fire within those who do not remember, or do not even remember that they ever remembered.

Vision-dreams, Deja-Jamais Vu, connections with higher spiritual forces - they all culminate, eventually, into the realization of the realness of this world and the inter-dispersed nature of our material being.

I have always taught that the Earth was a ship. Not any kind of ship, but an interdimensional spaceship. A living, breathing bio-organism that could traverse between a variety of timelines - with humanity being its crew. The engineers, the dock workers, the maintenance crews, the piloting forces. I knew this from the study of the art of physiognomy, as the first and most basic realization one achieves from the art is that humans are born with predetermined roles and dispositions. We each have a role to play and this is according to divine design.

Man's collective consciousness is what may take control of this ship and steer it, through vibrational manipulation and collective agreements. Yet the pyramidal grid that once connected humanity to one another was broken, and now we drift aimlessly in a sea of cosmos, under the same sun and moon - yet in a place where miracles are no longer allowed to happen. A dense, factorial iteration of a once-Atlantean civilization.

How distant and profoundly profane must this fantastical story seem to the average human being today, like some sort of manic daydream, one birthed of someone's overactive imagination. But what do we do when we realise that this is, in fact, truth - with proof of it scattered throughout our history, our ancient, burned and buried monuments and, most importantly, within the dark unconscious of humanity itself?

This life, this world, is a lesson of our choices.

And a lesson of faith.

Like we say, faith can only exist in a realm where proof cannot be readily provided or communicated. The sentiment of faith could not possibly otherwise exist. Thus, faith is the final lesson of this our strange and fleeting existence. Our world is designed, by higher intellect, in such ways - with the usage of such laws, limitations and boundaries - that is able to facilitate the concept of faith.

We are the amnesiac gods of this world, and we have inherited only sins of our own making. We are lost and have been for millennia and more - with only the dim light of conscience to guide us through these troubled waters, unable to face our self-inflicted trauma, our degenerate darkness, our regressive descent into the realms of forgetfulness and inverse liberation.

This distant place of beauty, the miraculous realm, is the final destiny of our race. The destined destination.

Eventually, we will arrive.

If only we could remember the way.

The sky features fluffy white clouds and a crescent moon, with additional butterflies flying nearby. Figures stand on a rocky shore in the foreground, gazing at the ship, while large butterfly wings are visible in the water.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gzb7kCmXkAAfytt?format=jpg&name=large)

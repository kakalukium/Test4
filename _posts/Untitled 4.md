Initiation into the sacred truth is done through consciousness, portal-gates and portal-keys.

Each is a state of mind achieved through the experience of a higher angle or higher state of being.

Both the outer and inner workings matter here, as they are brought into unison.

Emotions are felt but love is accessed.

Through purification of body, spirit and mind.

Love is not maintained by the outer condition, it is rather the sacred sap of the tree of life, the ocean of remembrance, through which all other emotion is granted context and meaning.

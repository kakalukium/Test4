STAGES OF SPIRITUAL MASTERY:

Stage I - The Breaking Of The Shell

You live life impulsively and reactively. A major traumatic event, or several, wake you up from your dormant state. You awaken to the first whispers of your conscious mind. You make your first ever conscious choice in life. You suddenly realize that you have never made a conscious decision before.

Stage II - Introduction To The Irrational

There are things beyond science now, a doubt seeps into your mind about what you've been taught to know, or programmed to understand. A rage within you builds against society, government control, authority in general. Something is horribly wrong with the world and you know it. This is not how things should be. Nightmares are common here, or vision-dreams for highly intuitive and sensitive souls.

Stage III - Rebellion Against God

\[Where most conflict, drama, social justice and duality is formed\]

The world is broken, disenfranchised, humanity is in its fallen state - you are sure of this now. Your spirit yearns for justice, yet still through human means - you become an ideologist and an intellectual by your own definition. Your pursuit for knowledge begins and you absorb literature. Your resentment towards dogmatic practice grows alongside your newly gained competence.

Stage IV - The Hidden Makes Itself Known

\[Where most fall off the wagon and never climb again, feeding worldly egregores\]

The stage of psychology and the occult. You have finally found the foundational steps that guide you towards empirical proofs and explanations for your irrational experiences in life. You seek masters, teachers, wise men of old and quote them religiously in your ramblings. You must explain why you are different, and how you're different. You form dogmatic opinions and ideals.

Stage V - Vibration & Synchronicity

\[Where LSD trips, drugs, altered states of consciousness are introduced into your life\]

You are introduced to the idea, at its beginning stages, that your inner state affects the external somehow. Your ideals become shattered again. You're still unsure of why and how, but you like to pretend to know more than you do. In truth, you are lost. You experience your first synchronicities and you are elated. You experience oneness through synthetic means like drugs or heavy trauma. Your luck with the opposite sex increases. You are wanted and needed.

Stage VI - Awe & Petrification, The Ego Trap

\[Where you become a problem to the system, make deals with devils, and where most ego-based spiritualists find their ends\]

You are in total awe of your newfound discovery. You are 'awakened', you are one with the all, your ego is finally dead - or so you have convinced yourself. Life comes easy here, you are incredibly elated, high energy, there's nothing you can't achieve. You vibrate at a high level and things seem to come naturally to you. Synchronicities are everywhere - yet you still don't know who you are and why you're here. In truth, you are losing just as much as you are gaining. You mess up your relationships without knowing, thinking you are advancing beyond them. You are enamoured with "magik", ancient manuscripts, tarot cards, astrology, numerology - all the formulaic arts. The world finally makes sense. You are fighting against the forces that be and exert great influence among your friends. Your ego, in truth, is just waiting to burst. Money and power feel destined.

Stage VII - Saturn's Tail, The Birthing Of The Shadow

\[Somewhere after the age of 30, where shadow work meets denial, and where most journeymen occultists find their doom\]

You have failed to learn from others, your ego has rejected your best teachers. You experience your first Saturnine return and become acutely aware of your shadow self. The dark night of the soul is here and it has arrived quickly and brutally. The results of your heedless actions finally find you, and wisdom is imparted unto you in violent ways. You are not the great person you thought you were, you realise all the ways you've brought suffering to others in your moments of cockiness, indifference and secret sense of superiority. Secretly, you have served dark means through your ignorance. Shadow work begins, it's time to dive deeper into yourself and finally face your skeletons. You begin to hate yourself, attracting all kinds of karmic return and punishment. Synchronicities stop completely, your luck and fortune fades, your charm and power are dampened and reduced. Your testing has begun. If you are not able to find penitence from your sins here, you will be in denial and still faking wisdom for the next 30 years. Your next duel with your shadow will not come until Saturn swings its tail again.

Stage VIII - Symbology & Parables

\[Where true wisdom is born and earned\]

You have begun rebuilding yourself again, block by block, piece by piece. You revisit, reanalyse and readjust your ways of life. This is a time of deep reflection, revisiting the old and understanding the real lessons they imparted - not just the ones that were beneficial to your ego. You naturally learn about symbology, how the universe speaks and communicates. Synchronicities cease completely - you no longer need the universe winking at you. When you watch old movies, cartoons and read old books - it's like you're reading completely new meanings. You begin to understand the deeper meaning behind symbols, archetypal stories, phonetics. Everything is interconnected. You hope to be a decent person and maybe a humble example or teacher to others on the same path. You have nothing to prove to anyone anymore, especially yourself. A deep religiousness consumes you and a gentle sadness is added to your aura. You gain newfound appreciation for beauty, art, compassion, humanity. You lose all and any desire to fight for money, influence and power. This new-gained sadness will be the mark through which others like you will find you. You have gained the ability to heal others through words, touch and song. You can finally accept the world for what it is, without judgement.

Stage IX - Spiritual Depression

\[Who you really are lives here, the new you is born - this stage can last for decades\]

You are poor again and 'struggle' with the same responsibilities of life as before. Remember, you restarted - this is good. You find meaning in the everyday, it helps ground you into who you are. Your will is tested against greed, financial instability, mundane responsibilities - but the fear of life has disappeared, and you are no longer vulnerable to your own emotions. You are the seasoned veteran scrubbing the toilets again. You realise that your ego doesn't get bruised easily anymore, you are no longer angered. You are in neutrality and peace. You slowly come to terms with the idea that the universe, at its ultimate root, is incredibly just. You are in a spiritual classroom - you are here to learn, and now it's time to teach yourself who you really are. You greet each day with a silent and cautious gratitude. Through mystical means, you are granted the secret of the meaning of life. You know who you are, why you're here, and what your mission has been this whole time. The problem is - you don't feel any motivation anymore. Your animalistic side is gone. There's nothing to survive for, no intense energy that drives you. You feel tired and exhausted.

Stage X - Meaning In Emptiness

\[The Realization\]

You can no longer 'burn' your emotions for energy, because your emotions are stilled. You finally understand that you are called to advance to higher forms of inspiration and find your life force elsewhere. You become a philosopher king in pursuit of beauty, passion, love, compassion, oneness. You begin to receive intuitive guidance, vision-dreams and subtle hints on when and what to do. You know the secret names of things, the secret meanings behind the turning of each wheel of life. You begin to flow as a vessel of the higher collective and enact its miraculous will. You begin to see the higher realms in your visions, you are brought to tears both by the beauty of the new world and the horrors of our current realm. Your only desire is to become worthy. You are not perfect but you strive for virtue with your whole being. You realise that the next stage is unavailable and inaccessible to you fully, and that it is inaccessible for everyone else as well. Unless the collective heals and awakens together - you may not advance to the next stage. You are everyone and everyone is you. You can't do all this alone. You need friends - good, reliable friends. The gates of heaven are closed until you are able to bring someone with you. Either all of us make it, or none of us really do. Suddenly, turning the other cheek makes all the sense in the world.

And so your journey as a spiritual teacher and healer begins...

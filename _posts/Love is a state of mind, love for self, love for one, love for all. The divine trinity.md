Love is a state of mind, love for self, love for one, love for all. The divine trinity to be accomplished for the soul to achieve full remembrance and self-recovery.

What stands in the way of this is shame, guilt, fear, hatred, anger.

All to be transmuted into Ambrosia, Nectar.

Offering forgiveness to all in the way to achieve this. Including forgiving oneself.


Emotions are felt but love is accessed.

Through purification of body, spirit and mind.

Love is not maintained by the outer condition, it is rather the sacred sap of the tree of life, the ocean of remembrance, through which all other emotion is granted context and meaning.

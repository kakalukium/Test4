Remember that this is a time for shedding, give and take. Weird feelings, emotions, ups and downs.

When things spiral out of control, holding on is the natural impulse. But nothing ever really spirals into chaos, they're just being reconfigured towards their rightful places.

Allow the things that require constant strain and holding on from you to disappear and melt away like last winter's snow.

Don't force it, let go of control and see where the pieces fall this time around. You can't control who comes to the party and you can't control who leaves.

Release even the need to do so.

Allow things to come to you on their own.

You breathe in the air that is closest to you.

You make friends with the people who choose you for you.

And it's easiest to love those who love you back.

He's not a spiritual and moral authority to her.

She just doesn't know how to say it.

Why I always teach that a man must be godly in his pursuits, not just comfy.

A lot of people who don't understand how women function will say she's ungrateful, but it's most likely not true.

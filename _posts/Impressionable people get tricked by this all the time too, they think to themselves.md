**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces 2025-07-27

Impressionable people get tricked by this all the time too, they think to themselves:

"Well, if they hold themselves in such high regard - they must be an important/great/amazing person."

WRONG.

This is how narcissists thrive in modern society, with glowing faces, their spit on their lips, and oily, greasy skin.

Know those marks.

Especially the spit part.

When a person doesn't mind spreading their DNA all over everything - that's the first sign of narcissism. Can be something as simple as them touching your food and thinking it's not a big deal, etc.

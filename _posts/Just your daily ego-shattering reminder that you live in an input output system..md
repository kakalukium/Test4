Just your daily ego-shattering reminder that you live in an input/output system.

Whatever biases you feed to the universe through your belief system - it will keep giving you proof of those biases.

Why?

Because it wants your ego to grow by being right - a self-inflicted trap.

Don't concern yourself with the "How".

Hold belief that it is on its way.

Create a sympathetic place for it to inhabit.

And remove yourself from the equation.

Miracles don't happen when observed.

Do not impress the logical unto life.

Make space for the mystical to occur.

Just your daily reminder that your ego needs to impress logic and numbers onto everything that happens in your life to survive.

Your obsession with things having to come to you in specific ways and from specific sources is exactly what's holding those blessings back.

Let go.

The waters of the world accelerate.

Vortexes form, portals aligned.

The great divide has begun.

Your home will be your spaceship.

Make it a good one.

They envy you, pure soul, because you can feel the flow and movement of energy without the crystal ball.

You intuit truth into being.

You need no formulaic system, no decades of learning, no divination, tarot cards, no reading the stars, nothing.

And that is why they envy you.

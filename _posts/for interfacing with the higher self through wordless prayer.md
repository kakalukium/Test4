My "Kaleidoscope Method" for interfacing with the higher self through wordless prayer:

Anyone can do it.

It is the most powerful meditative technique I can teach you. The idea is to bring yourself to the threshold of your higher imagination. To explore the boundaries of your ability to visualize.

It has a few steps:

1) Close your eyes. Accept the darkness. This will be your canvas.

2) Start with a single pale-white ray, emanating from above. See it travel upwards. Then see it disperse it into an explosion of colors.

3) Imagine it forming a distant silhouette. Something beautiful. The most beautiful shape you can. The most beautiful thing. The most perfect, sacred form. Envision it.

4) Now follow that form, add to it, wherever it leads you. And imagine something even more beautiful. Keep adding to it, in repetition, until you can't imagine further. Until you reach the point of awe and the edge of your mind's capacity for imagination.

(You will only reach further layers through repetition and practice here, through repeating the first four steps)

5) At this point - you sit in that space. The image is unfolding before you, whatever it is, it's alive. Jiving, swaying, reshaping itself in constant vibration, yet remaining the same. Whatever it shows you, tells you, gives you, how it makes you feel - take heed of it.

If you can't reach step 5, if it's blurry or choppy - the image. It's because you are untrained in maintaining the vision. This takes practice through daily attempts. But it becomes less difficult after a while.

The upper limits of your consciousness, the degree of your awakened self - the greater this is, the greater imagery you will attain.

This is why, outside of this group, I say that beauty is the portal to God.

Women don't commit forcible crimes - they commit (by current judiciary standards) non-quantifiable crimes, such as: psychological violence, economic subterfuge, deception, emotional abuse, manipulation, familial hostage-taking.

This is why there's no such stat for female crime.

And the only reason why women don't commit as much forcible crime is because they do not hold the upper hand in direct, physical confrontation and violence.

Yet they commit equal (if not more) amounts of crime in line with where they can use their weakness as a bargaining tool.

Funny story, men do that too. So if they’re committing both actual crimes and your apparent non-quantifiable ones, what does that say then?

The difference here is "predominantly". Yes, men do these too - yet they will go for forcible crime more often as they can overpower their victims. Women commit forcible crime as well but, of course, but predominantly they will go for mental gymnastics and gradual sabotage.

Bringing financial ruin to a man's life is "ethical misconduct"?

So if you poured poison in a cup your husband was very likely to drink - that'd be classified as an "unfortunate accident" by your logic?

Psychological abuse is THE PRIMARY PREDICTOR BY ANY RESEARCH for violence.

What do you mean?

Both men and women who abuse their partners are equally responsible for their karma.

There is no "but if" argument.

But yes, choosing the correct partner is very important - most people don't have the thought process to do so. Should we just blame it on them?





I understand your anger, but young women get to choose partners far more than young men can. Men rarely ever truly get to choose. Choice is a luxury afforded to the female side of the dating market. So yes, I don't think women should award the wrong men with their purity.

**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2025-07-27](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1949554253594239009)

The man who's come to know his own divinity, seen the destiny of this world (New Earth) - that man isn't a politician, nor is he a business maven.

That man is a poet, a bard, a wanderer.

He brings forth beauty into the world, because he knows that beauty is the portal to God.


It's not my highest value probably, but it is what I mostly live for.

I derive the meaning of life from it. Not in a philosophical sense (the objective meaning of life is not just beauty), but more on a personal motivation and inspiration level.

It's not the highest but close.

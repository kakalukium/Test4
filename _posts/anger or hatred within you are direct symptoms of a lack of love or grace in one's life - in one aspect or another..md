The fragility of the human soul cannot be understated.

Know that all things that stir anger or hatred within you are direct symptoms of a lack of love or grace in one's life - in one aspect or another.

A dream unfulfilled.

A broken heart.

A promise unkept.

A closure not given.

My heart's been broken for 7 yrs. I never wanted the pain to go. When it was sharp and new, I thought, 'One day I may not be so sad about it,' and that made me scream with anguish—the thought of NOT being torn up by the loss. I wanted to die. I'm tearing up now. I feel foolish.

Let every day be a celebration of the good times, my dear friend. Your grief and sorrow have guided you into gentleness and kindness. It is your strength - though you might not know it.

You need not feel foolish either - the love you once held will find others through you. ❤️

Thank you so much. ❤️

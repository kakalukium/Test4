**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2025-03-14](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1900362753870835877)

If a man is incapable of getting real fucking angry real fucking quick - that is no man.

Anger, controlled anger, is what defines a man's threat level. If you respond to having your boundaries disrespected with just "cold pragmatism", good luck retaining any boundaries at all.

Too much of our degenerate cultures, even modern spirituality, teaches us that emotions are just bad and naughty. But how can a messenger be bad? or good, for that matter.

An emotion is nothing more than a messenger that reflects to you what the external world is throwing at your ego. If your response to that is to disregard or suppress it - you're probably severely emotionally dysfunctional.

I know so many idiot kids who think it's some sort of moral victory to "trigger" other people too. Like "haha, you got mad, loser!" because they're so removed from the repercussions of that anger in modern living.

Spiritual people tend to say the dumbest crap sometimes too, like that sentiment of "if someone made you angry, it means they've won!"

That is possibly one of the dumbest things I have ever heard in my life.

If something angers you, it probably means that your boundaries are being pushed over their limits somewhere. Should that not, at the very least, be just cause for you to investigate and identify what exactly is going on around you?

Now, if you have relatively healthy boundaries (which you should), that should prove cause for some pushback at least, and when you stomp the ground and lay the fucking hammer down - the room needs to go silent.

And I mean any room.

You don't scurry away in some sad corner and call your parents for help now, do you?

It takes balls to be a man and to own your anger, something you can't ask of most men nowadays. There's only one thing that's more pathetic than a man who can't control his anger - and that's the man who can't even get angry at all, even when there's cause for it.

**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces [2024-02-11](https://x.com/JackOfFaces/status/1756652747498086675)

Feeling and emotion have a bad rap in spiritual circles - mostly because they are used as fear-mongering tools.

"A-ha! You got triggered!" - so you must not be in control of your emotions!

What if my anger was a response to my boundaries being disrespected? Idiot sandwich.

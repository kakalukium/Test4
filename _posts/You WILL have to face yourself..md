**JACK OF FACES** @JackOfFaces 2025-07-21

The universe teaches you:

"You WILL have to face yourself."

Whether we like it or not. If you don't go to your temptations, then your temptations will come to you.

You must walk your path with the consciousness you currently wield to the best of your abilities.

That's all.

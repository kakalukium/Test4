The particular strangeness of human beings is in that Man, as the tree-husk vessel of creation, is such a thing that houses both the Self and God at once.

The crossing ✝️ or intermarriage of these resonant forces are what give birth to creation and the material planes.

Any presence, demonic or otherwise, no matter how impressive, is a remnant of your unconscious mind.

It is the mystic-magician's job to determine and assign their respective places to what they are granted vision of to one of these two things.

All things you experience are either:

Borne of the Self.

or

Borne of God.

Nothing else exists. Nothing else is real.

It is only ever the Lesser Self (you) or the Higher Self (God).

Understand this principle and you will have granted yourself the Key of higher Vision.

Retarded psycho babble combined with lies.

There are ways of summoning spirits in PHYSICAL FORM. There are ways of getting possessed by them and actual ways of getting exorcised.

Demons are 100% real. Don't be deceived.

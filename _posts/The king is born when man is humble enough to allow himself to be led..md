The king is born when man is humble enough to allow himself to be led. 

And so his true teachers are brought forth - through his humbled spirit as invitation. 

And so is his relationship with God established - in worthiness. Divinity can't be summoned. It can only be invited.


Learn and know this, if it can be reached on demand - it is not divine.

If one can contact it on their own terms and at their own time - it is not divine.

If it can be persuaded to answer by striking a deal - it is not divine.

If it can be bartered with - it is not divine.


You will build a beautiful house.

With others, you will make it a home.

You will establish and respect the sanctity of that place.

You will cleanse it of bothersome ideas and thoughts.

You will set the table, clean, and you will save one seat for the divine.

As invitation.

Anything transparent.

In the water.

Charges under light.

It is a sunstone.

For one night.

Put that under a pillow.

And dream of brighter shores.

![The image depicts a luminous, golden-orange sunstone crystal partially submerged in calm water, creating gentle ripples around its base. The crystal catches the sunlight, reflecting brilliant rays and casting a warm glow on the water\'s surface, evoking a serene and magical atmosphere. The post text by JACK OF FACES 🎭 (@JackOfFaces) describes it as a transparent object charged under light, suggesting its use under a pillow for one night to dream of brighter shores, adding a mystical context. No watermarks from platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Xiaohongshu are present.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GxPPnNXXcAEUnJs?format=png&name=large)

I was obsessed with minerals when I was a kid. I have vague memories of being amazed by these expressions of nature. I haven't found yet what this should signal me

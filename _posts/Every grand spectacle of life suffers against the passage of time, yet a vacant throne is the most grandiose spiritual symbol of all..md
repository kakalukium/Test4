Every grand spectacle of life suffers against the passage of time, yet a vacant throne is the most grandiose spiritual symbol of all.

Why does the throne exist?
```

```
Why does the crown?

Meditate with me now on the symbolic meanings of these items.

These two artefacts are ancient gifts of higher knowing, yet the human mind that is incapable of understanding these symbols corrupts them with its impunity and ignorance.

The lesser mind believes that a throne must never be vacant, that it must always be occupied by some sort of ruling class or royalty - a power vacuum that must be filled endlessly and ceaselessly, until ultimate order is achieved through ultimate power.

An undertaking destined to fail from the moment of its inception.

When you ask me for my political ideology - which political philosophy I support or adhere to, I will always tell you - none that is man-made.

Because man-made politics, same as man-made law, is easily corrupted. Therefore, man is incapable of forming any sort of cohesive political movement or truly utopian ideology or form of rule that lasts the tests of corruption and time.

The very attempt at it is destined to fail.

Man's mind is too troubled to be able to comprehend order and longevity of order. And because his mind is full of chaos and self-deceit, so is everything he creates - because what humans wish to create in this world is the externalization of their own inner visions.

These visions are always flawed, because they are formed by a mind that is, inherently and unavoidably - flawed.

But how can man then possibly adhere to an order that is beyond man itself? How can such an order exist? Where or how can we even define it?

What if I told you that the mistake is in wishing to define it at all? In the incessant needing to define it.

You see, kingship and lordship are not passed down.

These are not ordained by blood and never were.

Blood inheritance is the only thing a failing nation has - when the guiding hand of God is removed from the equation, and guidance is no longer provided.

When worthiness and righteousness is lost, the hand of God recedes - and man is left to his own devices. This is the tragedy of our shared history.

Kingship is EARNED and granted only through necessity.

Look around you - look at all the vileness, deceit, destruction, perversion that is consuming this world. The evils of capitalism and the horrors of communism are fated to swallow it whole.

Why?

Because we still, to this day, cannot think outside of our own duality. Because your soul is in duality, torn in two in the most brutal and unforgivable ways. On either end of the stick - you are destined to doom the other.

But a society, one of wise women and men, who understands its own flawed and fallen state is a society who is destined to build the next great kingdom.

My aim has always been to bring about the idea of this kingdom - to plant its seed into the minds of those earnest enough to hear it and know it.

The throne is not meant for any man to sit in - it never was. At least not in permanence. The throne is an INVITATION, as all beautiful things are. A tribute to higher mercy, guidance and virtue.

When you build a bird's nest, the bird will come and find it and make shelter its there. Whatever you invite is sure to come.

The empty throne signifies the strongest initiatory force that exists in our realm - faith. And faith serves as invitation to higher beings.

When we remove ourselves from the equation, when we make space for the mystical and miraculous to occur - they always will.

And the miraculous cannot possibly occur within the boundaries of man-made logic and meaning, because man's logic - by nature - is flawed. You cannot hold within a flawed boundary that which is not flawed, that which, by its nature - is whole - or holy.

Understand then that a fallen mind causes everything else it engages with to fall as well. Quite literally, to fall out from its quantum superposition state of wholeness and collapse into its most likely state.

It is the flawed mind of man that yearns and needs for things to make logical, chronological and hierarchical sense. It is the ego-mind's insistence that all things must adhere to its all-consuming nature.

Why?

Because it must protect its existence. It can only exist as a separate thing only as long as it is able to make sense of everything it touches, feels or sees - for it to be able to convince itself of its own false godhood.

But know this:

The angelic cannot coexist with (or within) the logical.

And the logical cannot coexist with the angelic.

The moment you demand to experience a miracle and have it make sense within the boundaries of your personal logic is the moment you reject ever experiencing it.

"When a mind does not \*know\* itself, it is flawed. When a mind is flawed, the man is flawed. When a man is flawed, that which he touches is flawed. It is said that what a flawed man sees, his hands make broken."

They key to the new world, to New Earth, lies within our flaws and our ability to accept these flaws with the utmost hope, humbleness and grace.

The crown, the throne, kingship & lordship, all are symbolic for what man must always strive for but never truly reach - not in this life.

It is teaching you, the peak of every mountain, that some places must be left unconquered. When we consume everything around us with our sciences and laws and boundaries and deterministic logic, there is no more place for divinity to flee to, for it to find home and shelter in which it can be allowed to exist in its miraculous state.

A place is sacred not because we have decided that it is, but because we have made it so through collective intent - for it to serve as home to our highest hopes and dreams.

When you create space for the mystical to occur, when you make your body and mind into a temple through which the divine can interface with this fallen world - it will.

Thus, real power is not won or lost, it cannot be given or passed down - true power is ordained through higher decree.

The moment man realises this - the new world will be born, and access will be granted to the greater way of living and governance for the collective mind.

Before that - it is darkness and war and the meaningless struggling of wolves.
